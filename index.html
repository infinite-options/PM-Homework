<!-- In JavaScript, variables can be accessed from another file using the <script> tags or the import or export statement. 
    The script tag is mainly used when we want to access variable of a JavaScript file in an HTML file. 
    This works well for client-side scripting as well as for server-side scripting. 
    
    The import or export statement however cannot be used for client-side scripting. 
    The import or export statement works in Node.js during server-side scripting. -->
